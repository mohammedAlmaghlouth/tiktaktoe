# Tic-Tac-Toe Intelligent Agent 

This is a project for the COE 292 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course at KFUPM, As team of two members.

## Description

The Tic-Tac-Toe Intelligent Agent is a program that plays the tic-tac-toe game against an adversary. The program is an implementation of an intelligent agent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make decisions. The program is designed to be flexible and can be easily adapted to other games.

## Features

- The program uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make decisions
- The program is designed to be flexible and can be easily adapted to other games
- The program includes a graphical user interface for easy use

## How to Use

To use the Tic-Tac-Toe Intelligent Agent, follow these steps:

1. Download the project
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to a directory on your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the directory where the program was extracted.
4. Run the command `python tic_tac_toe.py` to start the program.
5. Follow the instructions in the graphical user interface to play a game of tic-tac-toe against the intelligent agent.

## Conclusion
This tic-tac-toe AI agent is a demonstration of the power of artificial intelligence in solving complex problems. 
With further development and training, the agent could be extended to play other board games or even compete in tournaments against human player
